# CabXpress
CabXpress is a next-generation ride-hailing platform that redefines urban transportation by integrating real-time video streaming with traditional cab services. Designed as a full-stack application

## Key Features:

**Real-Time Video Streaming:**  
Integrates live video capabilities to support features such as driver verification, in-ride safety monitoring, and potential entertainment services, ensuring a more secure and interactive experience.

**Robust API Integration:**  
The backend exposes well-structured RESTful APIs that enable seamless communication between the frontend and backend, facilitating efficient data exchange for ride requests, video streams, and user management.

**User and Driver Management:**  
Implements secure authentication and session management to offer personalized access, ensuring that only verified drivers and riders can connect, thereby enhancing trust and safety.

**Scalable Architecture:**  
Built with Node.js and Express, the backend is designed to scale effortlessly, accommodating high volumes of concurrent users and real-time video processing without compromising performance.

**Database Integration:**  
Utilizes a NoSQL database to store flexible, schema-less data, including user profiles, ride details, and video metadata, which is critical for handling dynamic data efficiently.

**Middleware and CORS Handling:**  
Ensures secure cross-origin communication between the frontend and backend, essential for maintaining smooth operations in a multi-domain deployment environment.

## Technical Stack:

- **Backend:** Node.js with Express for building robust and scalable APIs.
- **Frontend:** A modern JavaScript framework (such as React or Vue) that interacts seamlessly with the backend.
- **Database:** NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB) to manage dynamic and scalable data storage.
- **Video Processing:** Integration of video streaming libraries/services to deliver real-time multimedia functionalities.

## Innovation and Impact:
CabXpress combines the convenience of traditional ride-hailing with the power of modern video streaming. By offering enhanced security measures and potential in-ride multimedia features, CabXpress not only improves user trust but also sets the stage for future innovations in urban mobility. This project serves as an excellent example of leveraging full-stack development skills to create a sophisticated, user-centric transportation solution.
